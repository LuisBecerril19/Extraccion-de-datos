I think we people are really complex material. But since I guess it's good I say a bit, I would define myself as someone fascinated about living and getting to know both this planet and its inhabitants. I'm interested in serving people, especially, but not exclusively, my friends. I enjoy good food and if possible better company. My interests are broad and go from traveling, literature, creative writing, philosophy and body ""care"" to Buddhism.  I'm pushful, curious, a bit narcissist maybe, hahaha, and I guess I tend to dream pies in the sky far too often.

I am original Catalan, from lovely Girona - Costa Brava but I've lived abroad for many long periods: Miami, Dubai, Bali and Melbourne (Australia). My live partner is a lovely aussie-greek Personal Trainer named Stelios and, together we travel the world, when not working.

I like outdoors sports and I am addicted to mountain biking. I also like snowboarding, climbing, hiking, swimming ...; I also do some mat work like yoga and Pilates (of which I am a certified Instructor). 

I read a lot, books facinate me!!

I like to go out eating with my friends from time to time, although I am most of a day-creature and at night I like my sleep. I practice ioga and meditation and have a second level on Reiki. I'm a flexitarian (meaning I eat fish but not meat) by moral reasons and I enjoy a lot good food, if possible made with organic products. Music, all kind of music - depending on the moment - is very important to me; couldn't live without it. But my main and huge passion is travelling and meeting new people, travellers like me, or locals, and learn about them and their experiences in life. 

After many yearts working for others, I am now running my my own company. It's a fresh project dedicated to giving marketing and creativity services & solutions to other companies. I am also a teacher at the University of Girona, where I teach at the Faculties of Tourism and Economics and I run an international women's project named ""Grace of No Age"", devoted to mature women.

Mas Torrencito es una casa rural diferente. Una masÃ­a del siglo XV, restaurada con un estilo muy personal, y rodeada de campos, bosques y caminos que llegan hasta un rÃ­o que merece ser escuchado al menos durante un rato. Su propietario, Miguel, se ha encargado de darle su propia personalidad a la casa durante siete aÃ±os, creando diferentes rincones en los que puedes charlar con tu pareja disfrutando de una buena botella de vino mientras tus hijos juegan libremente por los alrededores, compartir con otros huÃ©spedes costumbres y anÃ©cdotas de tus mascotas mientras ves cÃ³mo ellas disfrutan y se persiguen felices, o subir a la planta de arriba y escoger una de esas pelÃ­culas que tenÃ­as pendiente para hacerte un homenaje frente a una gran pantalla. Puedes hacer lo que quieras, porque en Mas Torrencito la libertad se respira a cada momento y en cada lugar._x000D_
_x000D_
Marcos, Manuela y MatÃ­as, tres de las mascotas de Miguel, son el autÃ©ntico espÃ­ritu de la casa. Esos tres perros deberÃ­an tener contrato indefinido y pensiÃ³n vitalicia. Ellos muestran la casa a los nuevos huÃ©spedes, sus 8 confortables habitaciones dobles y triples, los baÃ±os completos, el salÃ³n de techos altos y vigas de madera, el antiguo horno de pan, la sala de entretenimientos, la piscina y el jardÃ­n con mobiliario y juegos para niÃ±os. Pero tambiÃ©n acompaÃ±an a los huÃ©spedes durante los paseos, entretienen a mayores y niÃ±os con su buen carÃ¡cter y sus ganas de jugar, y relacionan con las mascotas reciÃ©n llegadas con paciencia, cariÃ±o y una gran amabilidad._x000D_
_x000D_
Mientras tanto, Miguel cocina. Y cÃ³mo cocina. Platos elaborados con productos de su propia huerta. Recetas que le chivan las madres de los propietarios de los restaurantes de los alrededores. Bizcochos con diferentes sabores, mermeladas, cereales, pan reciÃ©n hecho y embutidos de la zona, una de las mejores del paÃ­s en esta especialidad._x000D_
_x000D_
Mas Torrencito se puede disfrutar en pareja si te gustan los animales, ya que es una manera de poder disfrutar de su compaÃ±Ã­a siempre que quieras. TambiÃ©n es un lugar ideal para niÃ±os, ya que rÃ¡pidamente se enamorarÃ¡n de Marcos, Matias y Manuela, probablemente la mejor buscadora de piedras del mundo. Y tambiÃ©n es un lugar perfecto para visitar con tu propia mascota, disfrutar de unos dÃ­as en la naturaleza y que los dos hagÃ¡is buenos amigos. En Mas Torrencito te sientes parte de algo, y cada visita es diferente a las demÃ¡s._x000D_

Mas Torrencito es una casa rural diferente. Una masÃ­a del siglo XV, restaurada con un estilo muy personal, y rodeada de campos, bosques y caminos que llegan hasta un rÃ­o que merece ser escuchado al menos durante un rato. Su propietario, Miguel, se ha encargado de darle su propia personalidad a la casa durante siete aÃ±os, creando diferentes rincones en los que puedes charlar con tu pareja disfrutando de una buena botella de vino mientras tus hijos juegan libremente por los alrededores, compartir con otros huÃ©spedes costumbres y anÃ©cdotas de tus mascotas mientras ves cÃ³mo ellas disfrutan y se persiguen felices, o subir a la planta de arriba y escoger una de esas pelÃ­culas que tenÃ­as pendiente para hacerte un homenaje frente a una gran pantalla. Puedes hacer lo que quieras, porque en Mas Torrencito la libertad se respira a cada momento y en cada lugar._x000D_
_x000D_
Marcos, Manuela y MatÃ­as, tres de las mascotas de Miguel, son el autÃ©ntico espÃ­ritu de la casa. Esos tres perros deberÃ­an tener contrato indefinido y pensiÃ³n vitalicia. Ellos muestran la casa a los nuevos huÃ©spedes, sus 8 confortables habitaciones dobles y triples, los baÃ±os completos, el salÃ³n de techos altos y vigas de madera, el antiguo horno de pan, la sala de entretenimientos, la piscina y el jardÃ­n con mobiliario y juegos para niÃ±os. Pero tambiÃ©n acompaÃ±an a los huÃ©spedes durante los paseos, entretienen a mayores y niÃ±os con su buen carÃ¡cter y sus ganas de jugar, y relacionan con las mascotas reciÃ©n llegadas con paciencia, cariÃ±o y una gran amabilidad._x000D_
_x000D_
Mientras tanto, Miguel cocina. Y cÃ³mo cocina. Platos elaborados con productos de su propia huerta. Recetas que le chivan las madres de los propietarios de los restaurantes de los alrededores. Bizcochos con diferentes sabores, mermeladas, cereales, pan reciÃ©n hecho y embutidos de la zona, una de las mejores del paÃ­s en esta especialidad._x000D_
_x000D_
Mas Torrencito se puede disfrutar en pareja si te gustan los animales, ya que es una manera de poder disfrutar de su compaÃ±Ã­a siempre que quieras. TambiÃ©n es un lugar ideal para niÃ±os, ya que rÃ¡pidamente se enamorarÃ¡n de Marcos, Matias y Manuela, probablemente la mejor buscadora de piedras del mundo. Y tambiÃ©n es un lugar perfecto para visitar con tu propia mascota, disfrutar de unos dÃ­as en la naturaleza y que los dos hagÃ¡is buenos amigos. En Mas Torrencito te sientes parte de algo, y cada visita es diferente a las demÃ¡s._x000D_

Mas Torrencito es una casa rural diferente. Una masÃ­a del siglo XV, restaurada con un estilo muy personal, y rodeada de campos, bosques y caminos que llegan hasta un rÃ­o que merece ser escuchado al menos durante un rato. Su propietario, Miguel, se ha encargado de darle su propia personalidad a la casa durante siete aÃ±os, creando diferentes rincones en los que puedes charlar con tu pareja disfrutando de una buena botella de vino mientras tus hijos juegan libremente por los alrededores, compartir con otros huÃ©spedes costumbres y anÃ©cdotas de tus mascotas mientras ves cÃ³mo ellas disfrutan y se persiguen felices, o subir a la planta de arriba y escoger una de esas pelÃ­culas que tenÃ­as pendiente para hacerte un homenaje frente a una gran pantalla. Puedes hacer lo que quieras, porque en Mas Torrencito la libertad se respira a cada momento y en cada lugar._x000D_
_x000D_
Marcos, Manuela y MatÃ­as, tres de las mascotas de Miguel, son el autÃ©ntico espÃ­ritu de la casa. Esos tres perros deberÃ­an tener contrato indefinido y pensiÃ³n vitalicia. Ellos muestran la casa a los nuevos huÃ©spedes, sus 8 confortables habitaciones dobles y triples, los baÃ±os completos, el salÃ³n de techos altos y vigas de madera, el antiguo horno de pan, la sala de entretenimientos, la piscina y el jardÃ­n con mobiliario y juegos para niÃ±os. Pero tambiÃ©n acompaÃ±an a los huÃ©spedes durante los paseos, entretienen a mayores y niÃ±os con su buen carÃ¡cter y sus ganas de jugar, y relacionan con las mascotas reciÃ©n llegadas con paciencia, cariÃ±o y una gran amabilidad._x000D_
_x000D_
Mientras tanto, Miguel cocina. Y cÃ³mo cocina. Platos elaborados con productos de su propia huerta. Recetas que le chivan las madres de los propietarios de los restaurantes de los alrededores. Bizcochos con diferentes sabores, mermeladas, cereales, pan reciÃ©n hecho y embutidos de la zona, una de las mejores del paÃ­s en esta especialidad._x000D_
_x000D_
Mas Torrencito se puede disfrutar en pareja si te gustan los animales, ya que es una manera de poder disfrutar de su compaÃ±Ã­a siempre que quieras. TambiÃ©n es un lugar ideal para niÃ±os, ya que rÃ¡pidamente se enamorarÃ¡n de Marcos, Matias y Manuela, probablemente la mejor buscadora de piedras del mundo. Y tambiÃ©n es un lugar perfecto para visitar con tu propia mascota, disfrutar de unos dÃ­as en la naturaleza y que los dos hagÃ¡is buenos amigos. En Mas Torrencito te sientes parte de algo, y cada visita es diferente a las demÃ¡s._x000D_
